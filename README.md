'kek-bot', or "кек-бот", is an associative knowledge base 'harness' for 'agents' for the obsidian knowledge management system.

One could consider it a kind of pop-up shared pedagogy for humans learning with/with the assistance-of-AI.

XEKBOT will, ideally, be a kind of 'agent' for the obsidian knowledge management system. When invoked and provided resources, it will 'cohere' and 'compact' disparate knowledge resources into a 'coherent' and 'compact' knowledge base.

This generation, XEKBOT, is specifically designed with publishing and public/private knowledge management in mind. He/She/It is, as it were, a groundskeeper of one's digital garden.
